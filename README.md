# House-Prices---Advanced-Regression-Techniques
Here, combination of advanced regression models for the prediction of dream house sale prices was performed. The training data and test data were retrieved from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

For the feature selection, correlation coefficients between variables were checked. Putting a cutoff of 90% for the coefficients, one of the features which are very similar to each other was removed. Also, the features which have more than 70% repetitive elements are also removed. With the remaining 44 features, linear regression, random forest regression and gradient boost regression models were performed. For each optimized trained models, predictions were made. Next, the median of each prediction was taken as a combination of the three of the algorithm.
